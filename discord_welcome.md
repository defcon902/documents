# Welcome

Welcome to the DC902 Discord server, DC902 was founded in late 2019 to create a place for hackers, tinkerers, and 
security professionals to share ideas and projects. We are a inclusive group and welcome everybody no matter the 
background or skillset, if you are a n00b or 1337, you have a place here.

## Code of Conduct
Please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/defcon902/defcon902.github.io/blob/master/CONDUCT.md), but in short, 
be awesome to your fellow humans and do not purposely do anything to make somebody feel uncomfortable or unwelcomed. 
If you feel uncomfortable in any way let somebody know and we will follow up.

## Channels

only real rules here are if things get political or heated or if you want to discuss something like that head over to #offtopic-fightclub
